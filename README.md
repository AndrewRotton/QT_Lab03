# QT_Lab03
Create a data-entry program that stores information in a vector of classes, then exports the info to a file

Create a form that allows a user to enter in personal information about cutomers.
The information should be:
  Customer Number (automatically generated)
  First and Last names
  Address
  City
  State
  ZIP
  Phone
  Email
  
  also, there should be a checkbox associated with the phone number which indicates if the phone can receive texts.
  
  Submit a form design to the instructor before actually beginning work with QT or C++
  
  You will need to create a class that holds all this information, then store it in a vector of classes.
  Finally, the program should store all this information into a file.  Go ahead and make it a text file, or a csv. Don't worry about encryption(unless you just want to).  The program should also check to see if the file exists, and read any information into the vector before beginning.
